# The Odin Project (Foundations Project) - Rock, Paper, Scissors
## Description
This project is part of The Odin Project (TOP) Foundations course and serves as a comprehensive exercise integrating all the JavaScript concepts covered in the course. The project revolves around creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game implementation from scratch, which can be played directly in the browser console and building a simple game UI.

## Project Objectives
The project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Browser Console Game
The objective of Part 1 is to create an implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript. The game should be playable within the browser console, allowing users to input their choices and displaying the results accordingly. This part focuses on fundamental JavaScript concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and user input handling.

### Part 2: Building a UI
In Part 2, the focus shifts towards building a user interface (UI) for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This involves creating HTML elements for the game interface, styling them using CSS, and enhancing interactivity using JavaScript. Additionally, this part reinforces knowledge on branching and merging in version control systems, as changes made to the codebase during UI development need to be integrated seamlessly.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, participants will have consolidated their understanding of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. They will gain hands-on experience in developing a simple browser-based game, handling user input, implementing game logic, creating UI elements, and managing version control for collaborative development.
